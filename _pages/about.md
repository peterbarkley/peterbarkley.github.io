I am a naval officer and a PhD student in Operations Research at the [Naval Postgraduate School] (https://www.nps.edu). My research interests include decentralized optimization, scheduling, and machine learning. In previous roles in the Navy, I've flown the P-3C Orion as a flight instructor and mission commander. I've also taught mathematics at the [U.S. Naval Academy] (https://www.usna.edu) and served as the lead for several cyber task groups. I hold a BS in Mathematics from the U.S. Naval Academy and an MPhil from the [University of Cambridge] (https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/admissions/cstit/), where I studied as a Gates Cambridge Scholar.
